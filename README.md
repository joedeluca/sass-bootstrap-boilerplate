# sass-bootstrap-boilerplate
A very simple Node.js/Express MVC framework to work through css/html design that allows one to write SASS. Bootstrap 5.0 source has been added, but can by deleting the include in blog.scss.

Note that any .ejs file you put in the views directory root automatically becomes a route, so there isn't any necessarily any need to edit the routes or controller.

## Use this how?
From the command line (I recommend VSCode's built in terminal: https://code.visualstudio.com/):
1. git clone https://github.com/joedeluca/sass-bootstrap-boilerplate.git
2. cd sass-bootstrap-boilerplate
3. npm install
4. npm run dev

Fire up localhost:8080 in your browser and get to hacking.
