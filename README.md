# sass-bootstrap-boilerplate
A very simple framework to work through css/html design that allows one to write SASS. It also illustrates a basic nodejs / express MVC project, though no models are implemented.

Any page you put in the views directory root automatically becomes a route. 

## Use this how?
From the command line (I recommend VSCode's built in terminal: https://code.visualstudio.com/):
1. git clone https://github.com/joedeluca/sass-bootstrap-boilerplate.git
2. cd sass-bootstrap-boilerplate
3. npm install
4. npm run dev

Fire up localhost:8080 in your browser and get to hacking.
